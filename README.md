# Trading_StockPrice
Here in this code below 
"Index.html" has "styles.css" as it's css file and also the code only shows the graph for 5 minutes interval of the opening and closing price.
In the HTML code "Test1.html"  i used css code "style.css" and it has two options of showing the graph for 5minutes or 1 day interval for the opening and closing price.
So for final code is Test1.html and style.css
